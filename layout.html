                    Although it should come as no surprise to most people who study dangerous dog breeds, the pit bull is the most dangerous dog breed. According to the aforementioned study, over a period of 13 years, the pit bull was responsible for 284 deaths, roughly 2/3 of all fatal dog attacks in the United States.
                    That is a rather discouraging statistic when one considers that only 6% of all dogs in the United States are pit bulls. They were bred to be dangerous for generations as hunting dogs and fighting dogs, so it is no surprise these dogs continue to be a threat to this day.
                    Another reason pit bulls are the most dangerous dog breed is that they have large bodies (weighing up to 80 pounds), strong jaws, and great killer instincts. Human beings and other animals donâ€™t stand a chance against a pit bull. Still, many people insist these animals are merely a product of their upbringing and have loving pit bulls as pets.</p>

                    Before pit bulls came into the public consciousness as highly dangerous animals, rottweilers were often considered the most dangerous dog breed in the world. These dogs can grow up to 25 inches tall and weigh 120 pounds or more and still be healthy.
                    They have large bodies and a temperament that can turn foul in some situations. Specifically, the dog will become very friendly and protective of those in its household, but that protection is not extended to visitors.
                    During the same interim as we discussed with the pit bull, the rottweiler was responsible for 45 fatal attacks, comprising 10% of all fatal attacks that were witnessed during that period in the United States. Rottweilers also have a dreadfully powerful bite that they know how to use to great effect.

                    German Shepherds are working dogs that have been put to use in militaries and police forces in recent decades. The reasons for this choice are obvious: these are robust, intelligent, powerful, and dangerous dogs that can inflict deadly attacks on people.
                    Weighing about 90 pounds and standing over 2 feet tall, the German Shepherd breed is perfect at curtailing human threats. The generational breeding into working dogs has resulted in a highly effective tool.
                    Unfortunately, this breed excels in aggression and territoriality, and they were the cause of 20 deaths (about 5% of all dog bite deaths) and numerous non-fatal biting incidents. The only silver lining, in this case, is that this breed is highly trainable.
